Best Workout Exercise for Back</center></h1>

<td><h2>1. Bent-Over Barbell Deadlift</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> <br>
This is probably the second-best back movement in terms of <br>sheer weight you can lift. EMG research has <br>suggested that hitting bent-over barbell rows will work <br>the larger muscle groups of the upper and lower back equally, making this a<br> great overall back builder.<br> Like the deadlift, this is another technical move that<br> requires excellent form but rewards you with a ton of muscle<br>.
<strong> In your workout:</strong>  Do bent-over rows toward the start of your back workout for heavy<br> sets in lower rep ranges, about 6-8 or 8-10.<br> The Smith version is a suitable substitute; it locks you <br>in the vertical plane, but your body has to be in<br> just the right position relative to the bar. <br>The bent-over barbell row has a significantly greater lumbar<br> load than many other back exercises, so it's best done early in your <br>workout in order to save your lower back.<br></td>

<td><h2>2. Wide-Grip Pull-Up</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> <br> It's always a good idea to have an overhead pulling movement in your back routine,<br> and the pull-up is one of the best. Wide-grip pull-ups<br> are excellent for putting emphasis on the upper lats.<br> A closer grip may allow for a longer range of motion, <br>but it may be possible to load the wide-grip pull-up to a greater degree <br>because of an optimized starting joint position. <br>The biggest challenge here for most trainers is training to failure in <br>the right rep range for growth, which is 8-12.<br>
<strong>In your workout:</strong><br> Because the pull-up range of motion is so long, several light reps make<br> great warm-up moves for the shoulder joints. Since form <br>is so important with these, it may be best <br>to push pull-ups toward the front of your workout <br>to ensure proper shoulder-joint positioning<br></td>

<td><h2>3. Wide-Grip Seated Cable Row</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> <br> Just about everyone defaults to the close-grip bar on rows.<br> If that sounds like you, you'll find using a wide grip<br> on a lat bar a nice change of pace because it shifts<br> some of the emphasis to the upper lats. <br>Wide rows mimic some back machines, so don't do both <br>in your workout unless you make some other kinds of changes, like grip <br>or target rep range. You might even try flipping your grip�and<br> going about shoulder-width apart�which better targets the<br> lower lats as the elbows stay tighter to your sides<br>
<strong>In your workout:</strong> <br> Like machines, cables are best done toward the end of your workout.<br> Choose a weight that enables you to complete <br>no more than about 12 reps.<br></td>

<td><h2>4. Close-Grip Pull-Down</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> <br> Since we've already covered the wide-grip pull-up, <br>the wide-grip pull-down is too similar, so we opted for the <br>close-grip handle for our pull-down selection. <br>EMG research suggests that use of a close neutral grip activates<br> the lats similarly to a regular grip, so you're not missing out<br> on any muscle fibers. As mentioned earlier with pull-ups, a closer<br> grip does allow for a longer range of motion and increased time under <br>tension for the lats, which is great for building muscle<br>
<strong>In your workout:</strong> <br> This exercise can make a good warm-up move for your shoulders, <br>but when used as a mass-building exercise, it's best <br>placed toward the end of your workout for sets of 8-12 reps.<br></td>

<td><h2>5. Decline Bench Dumbbell Pull-Over</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> <br> Pull-overs for back? Absolutely! This one mimics the straight-arm cable <br>pull-down you're probably familiar with. Yes, <br>this is a single-joint move, but it allows you to really <br>target and torch your lats. The decline <br>version puts your lats under tension for a longer <br>range of motion than when using a flat bench. <br>Just make sure the dumbbell clears your head,<br> and drop it on the floor behind you when you're done<br>
<strong>In your workout:</strong> <br> In almost all cases, single-joint movements should be done<br> last in your body-part routine. <br>Keep the reps on the higher end for a nice finishing pump,<br> around 12-15 per set.<br></td>
