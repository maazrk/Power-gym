<td><strong><h2> 1 More Overall Leg Mass</strong></h2><br>
Altering your foot placement on the leg press allows you to recruit<br> leg musculature in slightly different ways.<br> Putting your feet up higher on the sled shifts some of<br> the emphasis from the quads to the hams and glutes <br>because a greater degree of hip flexion/extension is taking place.<br> Also, don't shortchange the depth of your knee bend—which should <br>reach 90 degrees—by going too heavy—that also limits glute and hamstrings <br>activation. Unless you're following a pre-exhaust routine, <br>save the single-joint movements for last<br>.</td>

<td> <strong><h2>2 Greater Leg Definition</strong></h2><br>

Simply doing more work with light weight for high reps isn't<br> enough to get you lean. To keep your metabolism<br> high, you still need that stimulus for building and <br>keeping muscle size. That will help boost excess <br>post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), which <br>roughly translates to the number of calories you burn after<br> your workout is over<br></td>

<td><strong><h2>3 Starting Strong</strong></h2><br>

Learning to squat can be a challenge, which is why <br>the simple goblet version is a great place to start.<br> The idea here is to learn and practice movement patterns <br>before loading them with heavier weights or graduating to more <br>complex moves.<br></td>

<td><strong><h2>4 Emphasize Your Quads</strong></h2><br>

Because multijoint leg movements work your legs from<br> top to bottom, it's impossible to completely <br>isolate one area over another.<br> However, you can emphasize one area <br>over another. In this case, we're trying to maximize the range of motion of the <br>knee joint while limiting the range of motion at the hip joint.<br> One way to do this is by changing up your foot position on <br>machine exercises.<br></td>

<tr>
<td> <strong><h2>5 Emphasize Your Glutes</strong></h2><br>

While you tried to minimize hip flexion/extension in the <br>quad-focused workout, here you want to maximize it. <br>Do that by choosing exercises and foot positions that allow <br>the glutes to be trained through their full range of motion.<br> Be sure to descend fairly deep in all squatting motions;<br> otherwise, you'll limit glute activation.<br></td>
