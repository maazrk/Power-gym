Best Workout Exercise for Chest</center></h1>

<tr><td><h2>1. Barbell Bench Press</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong><br> You can generate the most power with barbell lifts,<br> so the standard barbell bench allows you to move the most weight.<br> It's also an easier lift to control than pressing with heavy dumbbells.<br> The exercise is easy to spot and relatively easy to learn (if not master),<br> There are plenty of bench-press programs you can follow to increase your strength <br><strong>In your workout:</strong><br> Do it toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets in lower rep ranges. <br>Consider varying your grip width for more complete chest development.</td>

<td><h2>2. Flat Bench Dumbbell Press</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong><br> With dumbbells, each side of your body must work independently,<br> which recruits more stabilizer muscles; dumbbells are harder to control than a barbell.<br> Dumbbells also allow for a longer range of motion than the barbell bench press,<br> both at the bottom and top of the movement. <br>Flat dumbbell presses allow you to hoist a fairly heavy weight, <br>and they make for a good alternative if you've been stuck <br>on the barbell bench for ages.<br><strong>In your workout:</strong><br> Do flat dumbbell presses toward the start of your chest workout for heavy sets <br>in lower rep ranges. We don't typically recommend doing dumbbell <br>presses in addition to the barbell bench press, <br>because both moves are so similar.</td>

<td><h2>3. Low-Incline Barbell Bench Press</h2><br> 

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong><br> Many benches are fixed at a very steep angle, which requires a larger contribution<br> from the front delts than the chest to move the weight.<br> If possible, go for a less-steep incline to hit the upper pecs without as much <br>stress on the delts. You can also easily do low-incline benches <br>with an adjustable bench on the Smith machine<br>.

If you're really looking to build that shelf of an upper chest,<br> EMG results have suggested that bringing your grip in a bit closer<br> may hammer upper-chest fibers significantly more.
<br><strong>In your workout:<br></strong> Many chest workouts start with flat-bench movements first,<br> then progress to inclines, but it's time to get out of that bad habit.<br> Every so often, start with inclines. The benefit is that you'll be <br>fresher and can lift more weight, which puts a greater amount of stress <br>on the upper pec fibers and could lead to more growth</td>

<td><h2>4. Seated Machine Chest Press</h2><br>  

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong><br> Free-weight pressing moves on a flat bench are great,<br> but the machine press has some unique benefits. For one,<br> it's easier to slow down the repetition, both in the concentric <br>and eccentric phases. Stack-loaded machines are also <br>great for quickly doing dropsets.<br>

EMG research demonstrates that the machine bench press recruits <br>much less of the three heads of the deltoid (anterior, middle, and posterior) <br>than free-weight variations because of a decreased need for <br>humeral stabilization.<br> This allows you to really target your pecs.<br>
<strong>In your workout:</strong><br> Again, do machine exercises at the end of your workout.<br> For anyone looking to build mass, machines give you a greater <br>chance to pump your pecs with minimal shoulder assistance.

<td><h2>5. Incline Bench Cable Fly</h2><br>

<strong>Why it's on the list:</strong><br> Not many single-joint exercises made the list, but this is one of our favorites.<br> It's an effective move to isolate the pecs after completing your <br>multijoint exercises. Cables allow for continuous tension<br> throughout the exercise's full range of motion.<br> If you've got a good chest pump going, nothing beats<br> looking back at yourself in the mirror as you squeeze<br> out a few more reps.<br>
<strong>In your workout:</strong><br> Do incline cable flyes at the end of your workout for slightly <br>higher reps (sets of 10-12). If you're training with <br>a partner, do a few dropsets for some real masochistic,<br> muscle-building fun!</td>
