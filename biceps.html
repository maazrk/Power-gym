<td><h2>1 INCLINE HAMMER CURLS</h2><br>
While you rate this No. 1, we give it mixed reviews.<br> The incline bench position increases the stretch on the long head of the biceps,<br> while the neutral grip increases emphasis on the brachioradialis and brachialis.<br> But the "hammer" takes some of the tension away from the long head, <br>negating the benefit you gain from sitting at an incline.<br>

Test this yourself by simply placing your right <br>hand on your left biceps. Move your left hand <br>from palm up to palm sideways and you can feel the tension<br> change in your biceps</td>

<td><h2>2 INCLINE INNER-BICEPS CURL</h2><br>
The biceps brachii actually consists of two portions or "heads,"<br> with differing attachment points.<br> The "long" head actually attaches above the shoulder joint,<br> which means that the position of the upper arm relative to the body <br>can determine how much each head of the biceps helps during a curl.<br>

This exercise gets your humerus behind your body, <br>stretching the long head to the max. The more horizontal<br> the bench, the more the long head will be stretched<br></td>

<tr>
<td><h2>3 EZ BAR CURL</h2><br>
Many find the EZ bar significantly more comfortable than a straight bar.<br> It shifts a little bit of the load from the biceps brachii to your <br>other elbow flexors, so an argument could be made that the<br> EZ bar curl is the best all-around biceps builder.</td>

<h2>4 WIDE-GRIP STANDING BARBELL CURL</h2><br>
Taking a wider-than-normal grip will cause you to externally rotate at the shoulder,<br> so your humerus changes its position. This prompts more <br>involvement from the short head of the biceps.<br> For this and all barbell curls, avoid cheating reps by leaning back.<br> If you want to overload the top, use bands, chains, or a partner for forced reps<br></td>

<tr>
<td><h2>5 HAMMER CURL</h2><br>
The "hammer" or neutral wrist position will typically be our strongest curl.<br> This is because all of our elbow flexors are actively involved;<br> the brachialis is worked the hardest. I would <br>recommend doing this movement like a concentration curl <br>or on a preacher bench. This should minimize cheating<br> and maximize recruitment.<br></td>
